abstract: "Fire disasters typically result in a lot of loss of life and
  property. It is therefore imperative that precise, fast, and possibly portable
  solutions to detect fire be made readily available to the masses at reasonable
  prices. There have been several research attempts to design effective and
  appropriately priced fire detection systems with varying degrees of success.
  However, most of them demonstrate a trade-off between performance and model
  size (which decides the model's ability to be installed on portable devices).
  The work presented in this paper is an attempt to deal with both the
  performance and model size issues in one design. Toward that end, a
  `designed-from-scratch' neural network, named FireNet, is proposed which is
  worthy on both the counts: (i) it has better performance than existing
  counterparts, and (ii) it is lightweight enough to be deploy-able on embedded
  platforms like Raspberry Pi. Performance evaluations on a standard dataset, as
  well as our own newly introduced custom-compiled fire dataset, are extremely
  encouraging. "
