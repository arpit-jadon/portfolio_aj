I completed my Master's in Computer Science from Saarland University and Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII) in April 2023. During my Master's, I was fortunate enough to work at prestigious German research institutes like German Research Center for AI and MPII. I have been working on different computer vision and machine learning problems since 2017 with applications in multiple fields like medical imaging and autonomous driving. I am always interested in expanding my knowledge base and challenging myself with novel real-world computer vision problems.
