I have been working on different computer vision and machine learning problems since 2017 with applications in multiple fields like digital pathology, digital radiology, autonomous driving, etc. I completed my Master's in Computer Science from Saarland University (Universität des Saarlandes) in April 2023 where I was fortunate to work at prestigious research institutes like German Research Center for AI (DFKI) and Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII). I am always interested in expanding my knowledge base and challenging myself with novel real-world computer vision problems.
